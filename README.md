## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Qtkfrfr082/Prodify.git
cd Prodify
```
2. **Set up environment**
Make sure you have Docker installed. Also, set up any environment variables needed for Firebase.

3. **Build & Run with Docker**
```bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
```
This should build the backend, spin up containers, and let you access Prodify via localhost (or whatever domain/port you've chosen).

4. **Configure Firebase**
Create or use an existing Firebase project

Obtain your Firebase credentials / config (API key, project ID, etc.)

Add them to your .env file (or wherever your app expects them)

## ⚙️ Configuration
Ensure you have a .env or config file that defines:

```dotenv
Copy code
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
# … other Firebase or backend-related credentials
```
If using Docker, ensure your docker environment variables are correctly passed.

## 💡 Usage
Once everything is up and running:

Log into the admin dashboard

View summary metrics (inventory value, stock levels, etc.)

Use the product management UI to:

Add a new product

Edit existing product (price, stock, etc.)

Remove product

Check analytics / charts (stock distribution, value distribution)

Monitor low-stock items

## 🧩 Project Structure
Here’s how the repo is organized:

```bash
Copy code
Prodify/
├── backend/             # Python backend services, API endpoints, business logic
├── frontend/            # Admin UI, dashboard, static assets
├── docker/              # Dockerfiles, docker-compose configs
├── config/              # Config files (.env templates, Firebase setup)

```
## 🛣 Roadmap
Authentication & user roles (e.g., admin vs viewer)

More detailed analytics (e.g., trend over time, alerts)

Export reports (CSV, PDF)

Notifications / alerts for low stock

UI improvements (theme options, mobile-friendly tweaks)
